## Requirements

## Usage

## Written Questions

### Exercise 1: How you personally use AI. 
Try to give a complete account of the AI you use on a regular basis. These can be explicit examples 
like ChatGPT or Copilot, AI-based image generation, or they can be implicit
within other apps like speech recognition or route finding. For each example describe 1) your experience (e.g.
how you use it, why you find it useful), their 2) strengths and 3) limitations, and 4) where you see these
heading over the next several years.

- Generate comments for code: I'll occasionally tell chat GPT to rewrite my code descriptions/comments. 

### Exercise 2: Intelligence tests. 
Perform your own Turing-like test on ChatGPT or similar large language
models to assess different aspects of the systemâ€™s intelligence. Describe and document (in terms of examples)
five distinct ways in which the model exhibits aspects of intelligence and five ways in which it does not.
Grading will be on the distinctness of your queries and how well each is designed to test specific aspects of
intelligence. Be sure to explain your reasoning behind your choices.
